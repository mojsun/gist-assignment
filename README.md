## Regex Components

## Anchors

An anchor is a special character that matches a specific position within a string.

Anchors are used to specify the location of a match, rather than matching a character itself.

The caret (^) matches the beginning of the input string, while the dollar sign ($) matches the end of the input string.

Anchors can be used in combination with other regular expression elements to create more complex patterns.

The behavior of anchors can be affected by various options, such as multiline mode

## Quantifiers

Quantifier specifies how many times a character or group of characters should be matched. Quantifiers can match a specific number of occurrences, a range of occurrences, or an indeterminate number of occurrences. Common quantifiers include \*, +, and ?. Curly braces can also be used to specify a specific number of occurrences. Quantifiers are combined with other regular expression elements to match strings.

## OR Operator

The OR operator (|) is a special character that allows you to match one of several alternatives.

The OR operator is used to create a pattern that will match any one of a set of alternatives. For example, the regular expression "cat|dog" matches either "cat" or "dog".

You can also use parentheses with the OR operator to group multiple alternatives together.

The OR operator can be used in combination with other regular expression elements, such as character classes, quantifiers, and anchors, to create more complex patterns for matching strings.

## Character Classes

Character class is a set of characters enclosed in square brackets [] that defines a group of characters to match.

Character classes allow you to match any one of a set of characters, regardless of their position in the input string. For example, the character class [aeiou] matches any vowel character.

we can use character ranges within a character class to match a range of characters. For example, the character class [a-z] matches any lowercase letter, while the character class [A-Z] matches any uppercase letter.also the character class [^0-9] matches any character except a digit.

## Flags

Flag modifies the behavior of the pattern matching engine. Common flags include i (case-insensitive), g (global), and m (multiline). Flags can be included at the end of a regular expression pattern or passed as an argument to the matching function. Their syntax and behavior may vary depending on the programming language or tool.

## Grouping and Capturing

Grouping refers to defining a subexpression within a larger expression using parentheses.

Capturing is the process of remembering the characters matched by the subexpression.

Capturing is done by assigning a capture group number to each set of parentheses in the regular expression.

Captured groups can be referred to using backreferences and reused within the regular expression or in the processing of the matched string.

Grouping and capturing can be combined with other regex elements, such as quantifiers and character classes, to create more complex patterns for matching and processing strings.

## Bracket Expressions

Bracket expression (also called a character set or character class) is a pattern element that matches a single character from a set or range of characters.

Bracket expressions are enclosed in square brackets [] and can contain any combination of individual characters, character ranges, or other bracket expressions.

For example, the bracket expression [abc] matches any single character that is either "a", "b", or "c".

## Greedy and Lazy Match

Greedy matching means trying to match as much of the string as possible, while lazy matching means trying to match as little as possible.
Greedy matching can lead to longer matches than intended, while lazy matching may not match as much as desired.
To make a quantifier (like \* or +) lazy, you add a question mark after it. For example, .? is a lazy version of ..
Lazy matching can be useful when you want to extract specific parts of a string that occur between known patterns, without including more than necessary.
Understanding and using the correct type of matching can help make regular expressions more precise and efficient.

## Boundaries

Boundaries are specific positions in a string where a match can occur.

There are different types of boundaries such as word boundaries, line boundaries, and string boundaries.
Word boundaries match the position between word and non-word characters, or at the beginning or end of a string.
Line boundaries match the position between the beginning or end of a line and a character.String boundaries match the position at the beginning or end of a string.

## Back-references

Backreferences in regular expressions allow you to match a previously captured group of characters within the same pattern.Groups of characters are captured using parentheses, and can be referred to later in the pattern by their number or name.
The backslash character followed by the group number is used to refer to a group by number.
The syntax (?P<name>...) is used to define a group by name, and \g<name> or (?P=name) is used to refer to it later in the pattern.
Backreferences are useful for matching repeated patterns and ensuring that opening and closing tags match correctly.

## Look-ahead and Look-behind

Lookarounds in regular expressions allow you to match a pattern only if it is followed or preceded by another pattern, without including the preceding or following characters in the match.
Positive lookahead is denoted by (?=pattern), and negative lookahead is denoted by (?!pattern).
Positive lookbehind is denoted by (?<=pattern), and negative lookbehind is denoted by (?<!pattern).
Lookarounds are useful for advanced pattern matching, but they can be tricky to use correctly and not all regex flavors support them.
